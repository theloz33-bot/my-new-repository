# Project Blueprint

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to interact with a Gemini AI model. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for sending requests to the Gemini API and displaying the results. The project will be built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will also leverage the Firebase platform for hosting and other backend services.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Project Setup:** Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files have been created.
*   **Blueprint:** This `blueprint.md` file has been created to track the project's progress.

## Plan

1.  Create a basic HTML structure in `index.html`.
2.  Add some initial styling to `style.css`.
3.  Add placeholder content and basic DOM manipulation logic to `main.js`.
4.  Link the CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file.
