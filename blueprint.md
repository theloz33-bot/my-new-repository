# Baseball Blog Blueprint

## Overview

A simple, modern baseball-themed blog website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The site will feature a clean, responsive layout and use Web Components for modular and reusable blog post elements.

## Project Outline

*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the application. It will define the overall structure of the blog, including a header, main content area, and footer.
*   **`style.css`**: Contains all the styles for the website. It will implement a responsive design with a baseball-inspired color palette.
*   **`main.js`**: Will contain the JavaScript logic for the site, including the definition of the Web Components.
*   **Web Components**:
    *   **`<blog-post>`**: A custom element to display a single blog post. It will include slots for the title, author, date, and content.

## Current Task: Initial Setup

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `index.html`**: Set up the basic structure of the blog with a header, main content area, and footer. Include placeholders for blog posts.
2.  **Modify `style.css`**: Apply initial styles for layout, typography, and colors.
3.  **Modify `main.js`**: Define the `<blog-post>` custom element.
